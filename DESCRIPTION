Description: Implements ROC-optimizing binary classification, supporting both
    linear and kernel models. Both model types provide a variety of
    surrogate loss functions. In addition, linear models offer multiple
    regularization penalties, whereas kernel models support a range of kernel
    functions. Scalability for large datasets is achieved through approximation-
    based options, which accelerate training and make fitting feasible on large
    data. Utilities are provided for model training, prediction, and
    cross-validation.
