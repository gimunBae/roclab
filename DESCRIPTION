Description: Implements direct AUC maximization in binary 
    classification, supporting both linear and kernel models. Both types of 
    models allow different loss functions, with linear models offering various 
    regularization penalties and kernel models supporting a range of kernel 
    functions. Optimization uses Adamax-type gradient descent, with scalability 
    achieved by training on sampled pairs (linear and kernel) and by Nystrom 
    approximation (kernel). These techniques accelerate training and make fitting 
    feasible on large, imbalanced datasets. Utilities are provided for model 
    fitting, prediction, cross-validation, and visualization of decision boundaries.
