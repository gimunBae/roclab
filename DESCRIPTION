Description: Implements ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)–Optimizing 
    Binary Classifiers, supporting both linear and kernel models. Both model 
    types provide a variety of surrogate loss functions. In addition, linear 
    models offer multiple regularization penalties, whereas kernel models 
    support a range of kernel functions. Scalability for large datasets is 
    achieved through approximation-based options, which accelerate training 
    and make fitting feasible on large data. Utilities are provided for model 
    training, prediction, and cross-validation. The implementation builds on 
    the ROC-Optimizing Support Vector Machines. For more information, see
