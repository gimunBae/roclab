Description: Implements direct AUC maximization in binary 
    classification, supporting both linear and kernel-based models. 
    Both linear and kernel models provide a variety of surrogate loss functions.
    In addition, linear models offer various regularization penalties, 
    whereas kernel models support a range of kernel functions. 
    Scalability for large datasets is achieved by introducing approximation options, 
    which accelerate training and make fitting feasible on large, imbalanced datasets.
    Utilities are provided for model fitting, prediction, cross-validation, 
    and visualization of decision boundaries.
